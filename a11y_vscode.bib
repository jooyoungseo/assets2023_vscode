  abstract = {With various challenging areas as the focus in software development, statistical modelling for software source code tries to derive the knowledge hidden in various software artifacts including code and text and help building robust systems which are intelligent. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is one area of focus in the domain. Since this provides platform for entire software development processes, it plays key role. In this chapter, study of intelligent IDEs is extended to IoT environment context. To begin with, we focus our study on understanding the IDEs and their capability. Exploration will focus on open-source IDE for mobile, and we look for better understanding the landscape so that we can extend the learning to the IoT world. In this work, building low cost IDE for mobile is focused open. Also, interestingly, exploration focuses on open-source components and possibility of putting them together. Then, in next part, we explore the IDE for Internet of things (IoT), with focus on open source ecosystem. In this review, we extend the exploration of IoT in to device management, data management, communication, intelligent data processing, security and privacy, and application deployment areas. This gives a greater insight in to the IoT world to extend the need of intelligent IDEs to IoT world. Then, to get the context of IDE in the machine learning context, we explore the topic of building optimal IDE for feature engineering which is one of the key phases in machine learning life cycle. Since machine learning projects are highly data-oriented eco system, learning of IDE and its insights in this area will provide rich insights in to the main theme of discussion which is intelligent IDE for IoT eco system.},

  abstract = {jGRASP is an integrated development environment that provides automatic generation of visualizations to improve the comprehensibility of software. These visualizations, which are particularly well suited for CS1 and CS2 using Java, include Control Structure Diagrams, UML Class Diagrams, and dynamic Object Views for data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and binary trees. The workshop will provide an in-depth introduction to jGRASP and show how to use the visualizations to improve the learning experience. Participants are encouraged to bring programs from their own courses and experiment with the visualizations for these during the workshop. jGRASP is freely available (http://www.jgrasp.org/).}

  abstract = {To support and accelerate the development of simulation protocols in atomistic modelling, we introduce an integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science called pyiron (http://pyiron.org). The pyiron IDE combines a web based source code editor, a job management system for build automation, and a hierarchical data management solution. The core components of the pyiron IDE are pyiron objects based on an abstract class, which links application structures such as atomistic structures, projects, jobs, simulation protocols and computing resources with persistent storage and an interactive user environment. The simulation protocols within the pyiron IDE are constructed using the Python programming language. To highlight key concepts of this tool as well as to demonstrate its ability to simplify the implementation and testing of simulation protocols we discuss two applications. In these examples we show how pyiron supports the whole life cycle of a typical simulation, seamlessly combines ab initio with empirical potential calculations, and how complex feedback loops can be implemented. While originally developed with focus on ab initio thermodynamics simulations, the concepts and implementation of pyiron are general thus allowing to employ it for a wide range of simulation topics.},
