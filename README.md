# assets2023_vscode

This repo is for a manuscript in preparation for [the ACM ASSETS 2023](https://assets23.sigaccess.org/call-for-papers.html).

## Deadline

July 7

## How to Write?

Please use `codespace`` and VSCode to edit the manuscript file (*assets2023_vscode.qmd*). You can preview the real-time rendered output by pressing Ctrl+Shift+K in the qmd file.

Note: it takes some time to install required LaTeX packages when you render the qmd file for the first time.

## Some Example Papers

We are working on experience report. Unfortunately, 2023 committee has not provided any examples on their official website. However, [2022 examples](https://assets22.sigaccess.org/experience-reports.html) can give us some ideas.
